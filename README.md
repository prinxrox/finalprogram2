Then you can navigate through and you must create atleast 1 company to create realtors next. 

Then you can go on sign ups and create profile of realtor via going on this link : https://mysterious-river-17439.herokuapp.com/realtors/sign_up

You can then perform various operations on realtors 

You can then also check and create profile of hunters by going on this link : https://mysterious-river-17439.herokuapp.com/hunters/sign_up

The only problem that Heroku is giving us it is not Signing Out for Admins or Realtors or Hunters because of inexplicable Heroku errors even though it runs perfectly well on the localhost:3000 site. We have used the devise Gem which handles the signups, signins and signouts perfectly well, but it seems to run into glitches on Heroku. 

If you dont want to navigate through the above links then you can to your browsers cache memory and again use the link  https://mysterious-river-17439.herokuapp.com to renter the credentials.
